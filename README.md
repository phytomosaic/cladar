# cladar: Critical Loads of Atmospheric Deposition Automatic Reporter 

The goal of `cladar` is to generate templates for **automated reporting** of air-quality information based on critical loads.

### Workflow

1. Jeremy: data processing, GIS -> clip to boundary -> save to files.
2. Mike: data processing, create CSV flatfile (rows = admin unit, columns = CL values).
3. Rob: generate reports, pulling maps from step 1 and tables from step 2.
